PROJECT DOCUMENTATION FOR KHARCHA APP

Frontend Documentation (Angular)

1. Project Structure
Why a Good Structure is Important: A well-structured project enhances code readability, maintainability, and scalability. Organizing your code into clear, consistent directories reduces complexity, helps onboarding new developers, and supports easy updates and debugging. Here's the breakdown:

core: Contains services and utilities that should only be instantiated once (e.g., Authentication service, HTTP Interceptor, etc.). This folder holds global services that are used throughout the app.

shared: Stores components, directives, pipes, and services that are reusable across multiple parts of the application.

features: Represents feature modules, each of which encapsulates everything related to a particular functionality (e.g., User module, Order module). This promotes modularity, allowing for lazy loading and better performance.

models: Defines the data types, interfaces, and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), which are used for type checking, and allows you to create strongly-typed objects.

assets: Includes all static files like images, icons, and other assets needed for the application.
environments: Contains environment-specific configuration files like environment.prod.ts and environment.dev.ts to switch between different backends or features in various stages (development, production, staging).

Best Practice: Keep the app modular, with each module focused on a specific feature or function. This separation also simplifies lazy loading, improving initial load times.

2. Naming Conventions
Why Consistent Naming Conventions Matter: Using consistent naming conventions helps with collaboration, improves readability, and reduces confusion. It allows developers to quickly understand the purpose of a class or variable just by looking at the name.

Classes: Use PascalCase (e.g., UserService, ProductListComponent) for components, services, and other class names.
Variables/Methods: Use camelCase (e.g., userData, getUserDetails()) for variables and method names.
File Names: Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., user-profile.component.ts, auth.service.ts) as it's consistent with Angular conventions and can avoid confusion with built-in class names.
Component Selectors: Prefix component selectors with app- or a specific feature name (e.g., app-user-profile, auth-login) to avoid naming conflicts and improve clarity.

3. Code Quality and Best Practices
Why These Practices Are Essential: Good coding practices improve the quality of the codebase, making it more readable, maintainable, and scalable. Following these guidelines also makes onboarding new developers easier and supports long-term project success.

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class or service should have only one reason to change. Components should only be responsible for rendering the view and handling user interactions. Services should handle the business logic.

Modularity: Break down your Angular app into feature modules. Each feature should have its own module that encapsulates components, services, and routing related to that feature. This not only makes the code more readable but also facilitates lazy loading (where parts of the app are loaded only when needed).

Lazy Loading: This improves performance by only loading the parts of the application that are needed at any given time. Lazy loading reduces the initial load time of your Angular application, especially for large apps with many features.

Services and Dependency Injection: Angular's Dependency Injection (DI) system ensures that services are provided to components where needed. Services should be used to handle business logic and data fetching, while components should focus on the UI.

HTTP Interceptors: These are used to intercept outgoing HTTP requests and responses globally. For instance, you can use an interceptor to inject authentication tokens into requests or handle errors globally. This avoids code duplication and ensures centralized control over HTTP calls.

4. Unit Testing with Jasmine/Karma
Why Testing is Crucial: Testing ensures that your application behaves as expected and reduces the chances of bugs being introduced during development or future code changes. Unit testing allows you to test individual components or services in isolation, while integration tests verify the behavior of the app as a whole.

Jasmine: Angular uses Jasmine for writing tests, which follows the BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) approach. You write tests that describe the expected behavior of your components or services.
Karma: Karma is used for running tests in a browser, which allows you to test Angular code in the same environment where it will run in production.
Example: Writing a test for an HTTP request in a service ensures that the service behaves correctly when interacting with the backend API.

5. API Communication
Why a Robust Communication System is Important: A well-defined API communication system ensures that your Angular frontend is able to communicate effectively with your backend. This involves handling HTTP requests, managing response data, and properly handling errors.

REST API Communication: Use Angular's HttpClient module to interact with REST APIs. HttpClient is easy to use for making GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., HTTP requests.
Error Handling: Centralized error handling is critical for a smooth user experience. Use RxJS operators like catchError in services to manage errors and provide fallback strategies.


Backend Documentation (Spring Boot)

1. Project Structure
Why Structure Is Key to Backend Development: The structure of a backend application plays a significant role in scalability, maintainability, and testing. The standard practice is to follow a layered architecture, which separates concerns into different layers: Controller, Service, and Repository.

controller: Handles incoming HTTP requests and delegates the actual work to services. Each controller is focused on one API endpoint or group of related endpoints.

service: Contains business logic and operations related to entities. The service layer handles interactions between the controller and the data access layer (repository).

repository: Contains data access logic, typically using Spring Data JPA for relational databases. This layer communicates with the database and handles CRUD operations.

model: Contains domain objects like entities (JPA) or DTOs (Data Transfer Objects). Entities represent data in the database, while DTOs are used for transferring data between layers.

exception: Defines custom exception classes and global exception handling. It provides centralized handling of errors and custom exception responses.

2. Naming Conventions
Why Consistent Naming Enhances Readability: Just like in the frontend, consistency in naming conventions is crucial for backend code. Consistent names make it easier for developers to understand the purpose of a class or method, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to extend.

Classes: Follow PascalCase (e.g., UserController, OrderService).
Methods/Variables: Use camelCase (e.g., getUserById(), createUser()).
Packages: Always use lowercase for package names (e.g., com.example.myapp.controller).
3. Code Quality and Best Practices
Why Good Practices Are Necessary for a Scalable Backend: Backend applications need to be robust, efficient, and secure. Proper coding practices and software design principles ensure that your backend can scale with your application while maintaining its performance and security.

Layered Architecture: This principle advocates for dividing your application into distinct layers (Controller → Service → Repository). It ensures separation of concerns and makes the application more modular and maintainable.

DTOs and Entities: DTOs are used for transferring data between layers and over the network. Never expose entities directly as they might include sensitive data or database-specific attributes.

Exception Handling: Use global exception handling (@ControllerAdvice) to manage errors across the entire application. This centralizes error logic and provides consistent responses to the client.

4. Unit Testing with JUnit and Mockito
Why Testing in the Backend is Essential: Backend tests help verify the correctness of your business logic and ensure that your services interact correctly with the database or external systems. Unit tests allow you to test individual components, while integration tests verify that everything works together.

JUnit: Used for testing individual methods and components. Write tests that check whether a service method works as expected.

Mockito: Use Mockito for mocking dependencies (like repositories or external APIs) in unit tests to isolate the behavior of the unit being tested.

Example: Writing unit tests for services ensures that business logic behaves correctly. Mocking dependencies like the database layer using Mockito ensures that tests are independent of the actual database.

5. API Testing with Concordion
Why Concordion is Useful for API Testing: Concordion provides Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) style tests that are written in a human-readable format. You can use Concordion to write specifications in plain language and automate tests for APIs or other backend functionality.

Specification Files: In Concordion, you define specifications in HTML-like files. These specifications outline the expected behavior of an API or feature.

Java Steps: The Java code executes the steps described in the specifications, interacting with the backend to verify that the expected behavior is met.

6. Integration Testing
Why Integration Testing is Necessary: Integration tests ensure that multiple components work together as expected. For backend applications, this involves testing the entire application stack (Controller → Service → Repository). Use @SpringBootTest for full-stack integration tests.
